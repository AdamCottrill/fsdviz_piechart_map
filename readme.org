* Creating dynamic check boxes with d3 and crossfilter2

This little project is a demonstration of how dynamic check boxes can
be created (or destroyed) to reflect currently available dimensions in
a crossfilter2 object. They function essentially the same as plots
created using dc.js but with check boxes.
