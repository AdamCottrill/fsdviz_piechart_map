* Creating dynamic pie charts on a map using d3 and crossfilter

This little project is part of a larger project to visualize great
lakes fish stocking data. This project is in support of a widget, or
dashboard that will display stocking data as interactive pie charts
that can be filtered, aggregated, or split by user. This is not
intended to be a stand alone project, but will be integrated into the
larger application.
